# multiarch-pipeline-test

This is a test repo that serves as an example of publishing multi-arch Docker builds with Drone.

Some comments exist inline in the included files and more robust documentation is forthcoming.

Builds from this pipeline are deployed to Docker Hub for validation as [IamTheFij/multiarch-pipeline-test](https://hub.docker.com/r/iamthefij/multiarch-pipeline-test).
